* Technical Questions
- Q: Straight webgl or find a library?
- A: straight up webgl


- Q: How do you deal with camera?
- A: There's a big array of map locations
     there's a camera vector
     we use the two of those to figure out what to draw


- Q: How are we going to display the giant kaiju?

* Game Ideas
- Kaiju roguelike
  - big, multi-tile monsters
    - direct hit from kaiju, obscene amount of damage, almost always insta-death
    = kaiju more often do environment damage, and chunks of terrain etc can hit the player
  - level structure
    - lots of obstacles, buildings, etc
    - the remains of tokyo after the kaiju showed up
    - streets, alleys
    - you can hide in a building, but kaiju can break down the building
    - every building has an escape/back door/etc
    - one giant map
    - you need several maguffins to put together to destroy the kaiju breeding grounds
    - the maguffins attract kaiju, so progression
    - use perlin noise or something to create a kaiju density map
  - terrain features
    - buildings
    - parks
    - highways that restrict movement with controlled access
    - vending machines
      - money operated
      - usually heal you (random)
      - some random positive effect sometimes
      - unknown finite uses
  - vehicle-based movement
    - motorcycle:
      - 2x1
      - draw as:   %@
      - wasd to move
      - you have a speed and a facing
        - reticle for indicator
      - moving along with your facing increases your speed
        - diminishing return on acceleration? (maybe not)
          - ie accel 1 -> speed 2, accel 3 -> speed 3, accel 6 -> speed 4
      - a right turn halves your speed
      - a reverse brakes
        - braking continues for speed/2
        - causes the motorcycle to turn right/left
        - speed goes to 0
      - use the shift keys to modify movement
        - shift + brake is a weaker brake
        - shift + left/right strafes
        - shift + forward maintains speed
      - crash:
        - separated from motorcycle
        - need to walk back to it (normal 4-dir mvoement)
        - on the turn you would have crashed, you leap off the motorcycle and let it crash instead
          - you do not move
          - the motorcycle does
          - motorcycle loses some hp
            - at zero, its broken
        - same if you send it into a kaiju
          - damage to enemy proportional to speed

mapgen:
  - there's a cool thing that happens in cities:
    when you have two different neighborhoods on grid systems, but the grids are at different angles and they meet
  - generating by chunks of city blocks
    - they vary in some way:
      - all grids are NSEW aligned
      - street width, in any direction
      - street spacing (controls block width, height)
      - building size
      - what % of a block is building/open
      - degree of destruction
      - zoning
        - residential 
          - more vending machines, smaller buildings
        - industrial
          - larger buildings, more kaiju eggs
        - commercial
          - more loot, piles of money
        - kaiju nest
          - how do we indicate to the player that it is a kaiju nest?
  - map features
    - obstacles?
    - trail of destruction

kaiju behavior:
  - when you aren't around:
    - walk in a straight line
    - active destruction
  - Q: how do you aggro a kaiju?

eg blocks are 50x50

terrain types:
  - " grass
  - asphalt
    - painted asphalt (for road stripes)
  - . interior
  - ^ tree
  - O rubble (impassable to player, passable to monster)
  - ; debris (slows)
  - 0 eggs (monsters do not destroy, impassable to monsters, player can run them over)
  - fat + glass door
    - shoot it to break it
    - can crash through it
  - + wooden door
    - open/closed
  - # wall
  - = glass wall / window
    - shoot it to break it
    - can crash through it

motorcycles:
 - lots of spare motorcycles scattered throughout the map
 - they have varying attributes
   - model name
   - hp
   - damage
   - top speed
   - acceleration curve
     - eg: [1,1,1,1,1,1] accel by 1 at any speed
     - eg: [3,1,1,1,1,1] accel by 3 from a stop, otherwise by 1
     - eg: [2,2,2,2,1]
     - instead of throwing these numbers at the player, display a "horsepower"
       and make the exact curve discovered


2500 x 2500 -> 50 blocks x 50 blocks (2500 blocks)



- "gun-type"
   base damage + N scaling damage
   driven by consecutive attacks on the same enemy
   - params:
      - base
      - scale

   - params:
      - damage

  - the map has low hp kaiju eggs that count for this
  - params:
    - damage

  - hachimaki
  - briefcase

  - ...



- weapons:
  - gun
    - basic shot does 1 damage
    - sometimes it becomes useful somehow
  - artillery strike
    - paint target for N turns
    - then the artillery lands
  - paint to target a missile?
  - paint to target a nuclear weapon?
  - poisonous dart (engineered anti-kaiju virus)
    - takes time to take effect
  - death ray (radiation damage)
    - restrictions: splashback, not affected by multipliers
  - regeneration inhibitor:
    - increases damage of subsequent attacks
    - has a cooldown
    - the bonuses are color-coded
  - psi lance
    - has bonus damage based on overkill delivered to other enemies recently

- game about compounding numbers
  - damage types:
     radiation: does a percentage of current enemy health
     viral: over time, stacks up an increasing multiplier on incoming damage
     combo: a sequence of moves that increase the damage of immediately (ish) following moves
     overkill: bonus damage to later attacks from excess damage dealt to other enemies
     crit clock: 
       - clock 1: 2x damage every other turn
       - clock 2: 2x damage every 3rd turn
       - clock 3: 2x damage every 5rd turn
       - ...

- progression:
  - Your level is the size of the biggest kaiju you have taken down
  - higher level means you can carry more items
  - items in inventory have an order
  - stat buffs from earlier items affect the impact of later items
    - some items have stat buffs that scale with a stat

- stats:
  - destiny (luck)
  - accuracy
  - fitness
  - acuity
  - focus
  - determination
